     * This new ViewHolder should be constructed with a new View that can represent the items
     * of the given type. You can either create a new View manually or inflate it from an XML
     * layout file.
     * <p/>
     * The new ViewHolder will be used to display items of the adapter using
     * {@link #onBindViewHolder(ViewHolder, int, List)}. Since it will be re-used to display
     * different items in the data set, it is a good idea to cache references to sub views of
     * the View to avoid unnecessary {@link View#findViewById(int)} calls.
     *
     * @param parent   The ViewGroup into which the new View will be added after it is bound to
     *                 an adapter position.
     * @param viewType The view type of the new View.
     * @return A new ViewHolder that holds a View of the given view type.
